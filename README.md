## INTRODUCTION
Effective inventory management is critical to operational efficiency, cost control, and customer satisfaction in any product-based business. This report presents a comprehensive analysis of an inventory dataset obtained from the FP20 Data Challenge (April edition), which simulates the inventory system of a hypothetical multinational company. The dataset includes 5,000 unique products spanning seven categories—Books, Clothing, Electronics, Home & Garden, Office Supplies, Sports, and Toys—alongside detailed information on stock levels, pricing, suppliers, restocking schedules, and geographic distribution across 10 European countries. The goal of this analysis is to uncover trends, identify inefficiencies, and provide actionable insights that can support smarter inventory planning, optimize stock movement, and minimize the risks of overstocking or stockouts.
